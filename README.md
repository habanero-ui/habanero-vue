# Discussion Points

## Buttons

- Using opacity/percentage to handle hover/active states of buttons (instead of 3 separate colors like what we see with error buttons in styleguide)
- Do we want the loading-indicator color to match the button text color?

## Icons (these are a mute point if we replace one at a time with icons that fit conditions/params)

- Info in app is different than latest screens
- Info on settings screen is different than info in data tables
- Bell in app is different than latest screens
- Chevrons are inconsistent left/right to up/down
- Plus and minus are THICK
- Consider renaming Pennant to Flag because it has a pole
- All icons on the settings screen do not match what is currently in the app - Flag (Pennant) - MapMarked

## Loading Indicator

- How do we want to position the loading indicator? Should it always be absolutely positioned?
